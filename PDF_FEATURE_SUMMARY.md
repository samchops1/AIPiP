# PDF Generation & Enhanced Sample Data Implementation

## Successfully Implemented Features

### 1. PDF Generation System ✅
Created comprehensive PDF generation for:

#### Termination PDFs
- **Automatic generation** when employees are terminated
- **Includes**: Employee details, performance scores, utilization rates, termination reasons
- **Professional format** with headers, sections, and footer
- **File naming**: `Termination_[EmployeeID]_[Timestamp].pdf`
- **Storage**: `/generated_pdfs/` directory

#### Coaching Session PDFs
- **Generated automatically** for each coaching session
- **Includes**: Session date, type, performance score, feedback, action items
- **Performance analysis** with level indicators (Excellent/Good/Satisfactory/Needs Improvement)
- **Next session scheduling** automatically calculated
- **File naming**: `Coaching_[EmployeeID]_[Timestamp].pdf`

#### PIP Documentation PDFs
- **Generated for each PIP** created
- **Comprehensive details**: Goals, coaching plan, success criteria
- **Improvement tracking**: Initial vs current scores, improvement rate calculation
- **Professional formatting** for official documentation
- **File naming**: `PIP_[EmployeeID]_[Timestamp].pdf`

#### Bulk Performance Report PDFs
- **Executive summary** with key metrics
- **PIP statistics**: Active, completed, terminated, success rate
- **Company distribution** analysis (for multi-company portfolios)
- **Performance trends** with averages and thresholds
- **Recommendations** section for management actions
- **File naming**: `Performance_Report_[Timestamp].pdf`

### 2. Enhanced Sample Data Generation ✅

#### 50 PIP Employees
- **Employees emp-007 through emp-056** are designated as PIP candidates
- **Each PIP employee has**:
  - 12 weeks of performance history
  - Initial poor performance (55-70% scores)
  - 70% show improvement trajectory
  - 30% continue poor performance
  - Complete PIP documentation with PDF

#### Realistic Performance Patterns
- **PIP employees show two patterns**:
  1. **Improved (70%)**: Start at 55-70%, improve to 75-85% after 6 weeks
  2. **Not Improved (30%)**: Remain at low performance levels
- **Utilization tracking** correlates with performance
- **Weekly coaching sessions** for 4 weeks per PIP employee

#### Automatic Actions Post-Generation
When sample data is generated, the system automatically:
1. **Runs PIP evaluation** to identify new candidates
2. **Performs bias check** across all employees
3. **Generates PDFs** for:
   - All 50 PIP documentation
   - 200+ coaching sessions (4 per PIP employee)
   - Bulk performance report
4. **Calculates improvement rate** (typically ~70%)
5. **Creates comprehensive audit logs**

### 3. Integration with Existing Systems ✅

#### Auto-Firing System
- **PDF generation on termination**: Each terminated employee gets official PDF
- **Stored in system**: Path tracked in database
- **Audit trail**: Complete documentation for compliance

#### Coaching Management
- **Automated PDF creation**: Every coaching session documented
- **Performance tracking**: Visual progress in PDFs
- **Action items**: Customized based on performance level

#### PIP Workflow
- **Initial PIP PDF**: Generated when PIP starts
- **Weekly coaching PDFs**: Track progress throughout PIP
- **Final outcome documentation**: Success or termination PDF

### 4. Performance Metrics ✅

#### Sample Data Scale
- **1000+ employees** across 200 companies
- **50 PIP employees** with full documentation
- **200+ coaching sessions** with PDFs
- **1500+ performance metrics** generated
- **70% improvement rate** for PIP employees

#### PDF Generation Performance
- **Async generation**: Non-blocking PDF creation
- **Batch processing**: Multiple PDFs generated efficiently
- **File management**: Organized directory structure
- **Error handling**: Graceful failures with logging

## API Endpoint Updates
