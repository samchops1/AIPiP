# Auto-Termination Analysis - Expected Results

## System Settings & Criteria

### Termination Thresholds:
- **Score Threshold**: < 70%
- **Utilization Threshold**: < 60%
- **Consecutive Periods**: 3 periods required
- **Both Criteria**: Employee must fail BOTH score AND utilization for 3+ consecutive periods

## Sample Data Analysis

### Employees Designed for Termination:

#### 1. **Marcus Johnson (emp-003)** - QA Engineer ✅ SHOULD TERMINATE
- **Status**: Active (eligible for termination)
- **Performance Pattern**:
  - Score: 50-65% (consistently below 70% threshold)
  - Utilization: 45-57% (consistently below 60% threshold)
  - Duration: 12 consecutive periods of poor performance
- **Termination Criteria**: ✅ **MEETS ALL CRITERIA**

#### 2. **David Kim (emp-005)** - Data Analyst ✅ SHOULD TERMINATE  
- **Status**: Active (eligible for termination)
- **Performance Pattern**:
  - Recent 4 periods: Score 55-63%, Utilization 45-53%
  - Older periods: Score 78-86%, Utilization 75-83%
  - **Recent severe decline** in last 4 periods
- **Termination Criteria**: ✅ **MEETS ALL CRITERIA** (recent 4 periods below both thresholds)

#### 3. **Jennifer Wilson (emp-006)** - Sales Representative
- **Status**: Already terminated (sample data)
- **Note**: Pre-terminated for demo purposes, not counted in auto-firing

### Employees NOT Expected to Terminate:

#### 1. **Alex Thompson (emp-001)** - Software Engineer ❌ NO TERMINATION
- **Performance**: Score 85-100%, Utilization 85-95%
- **Status**: High performer, well above thresholds

#### 2. **Sarah Chen (emp-002)** - Product Manager ❌ NO TERMINATION
- **Performance**: Recent improvement to 78-88% score, 75-83% utilization
- **Status**: Above thresholds in recent periods

#### 3. **Emily Rodriguez (emp-004)** - Designer ❌ NO TERMINATION
- **Status**: Already on PIP (status = "pip")
- **Performance**: Inconsistent (50-95% score, 50-85% utilization)
- **Note**: Cannot be terminated while on active PIP

### 4. **50 Additional PIP Employees (emp-007 to emp-056)**
- **Status**: All have status = "pip"
- **Performance**: Mixed improvement patterns
- **Note**: Cannot be auto-terminated while on active PIP
- **Expected Outcome**: Some may be terminated through PIP failure process, not auto-firing

### 5. **944 Other Employees (emp-057 to emp-1000)**
- **Status**: Active
- **Performance**: Random generation - some good, some poor
- **Expected Terminable**: ~10-15% based on random distribution
- **Note**: Only first ~150 have detailed performance metrics generated

## Expected Auto-Termination Results

### **Total Expected Terminations: 2-4 employees**

#### **Confirmed Terminations (2)**:
1. **Marcus Johnson (emp-003)** - Consistent poor performance
2. **David Kim (emp-005)** - Recent severe decline

#### **Possible Additional Terminations (0-2)**:
- Some of the randomly generated employees (emp-057 to emp-150) may meet criteria
- Depends on random performance data generated

### **Employees Protected from Auto-Termination**:
- **50 PIP employees** (emp-007 to emp-056) - Status = "pip"
- **1 Pre-terminated** (emp-006) - Status = "terminated" 
- **High performers** (emp-001, emp-002) - Above thresholds

## Auto-Firing Demo Results

### When running the auto-firing demo, you should see:

```
⚠️ 2-4 employee(s) terminated due to poor performance

TERMINATED employees:
1. Marcus Johnson (QA Engineer)
   - Final Score: ~58%
   - Final Utilization: ~51% 
   - Reason: Consistent poor performance for 12+ consecutive periods

2. David Kim (Data Analyst)  
   - Final Score: ~59%
   - Final Utilization: ~49%
   - Reason: Recent severe performance decline

[Possibly 0-2 additional randomly generated employees]
```

### PDFs Generated:
- **Termination letters** for each terminated employee
- **Professional format** with current system date
- **Downloadable immediately** after termination processing

## Performance Metrics

### **Termination Rate**: ~0.2-0.4% of total workforce
- 2-4 terminations out of 1000 employees
- **Realistic rate** for enterprise auto-firing system
- **Conservative approach** requiring both score AND utilization failures

### **PIP Success Rate**: ~70%
- 50 employees on PIP
- ~35 expected to improve and avoid termination
- ~15 may face termination after PIP completion

## Summary

The auto-firing system is designed to be **conservative and accurate**, terminating only employees who consistently fail multiple performance criteria. The expected **2-4 terminations** demonstrates responsible automation that catches severe performance issues while protecting employees who are improving or have temporary performance dips.
